hi, this program increases FPS in growth due to the removal of areas in which you are not present
Why do you need an area where you are not even there? Rast did not take this into account and this is why lags occur

for this program to work, you need to launch Rast itself, and then my program, it will automatically work, you donâ€™t need to press anything
In the next update I will try to reduce the file size so that the load is less
